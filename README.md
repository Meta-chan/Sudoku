# Welcome to Sudoku!

 Small program to solve sudokus. Nothing to explain. Interface is primitive: the program accepts nine lines, nice symbols each. Symbols `1..9` stand for known numbers, any other characters stand for unknowns.
 
 For quick example do this:
 ```
 sudoku < test.txt
 ```

###### P.S. My code is not dirty, it is alternatively clean.
